### This project will persist of a frontend in VueJs, Backend in Express Js and database in MongoDB

# Planning

For the past year I have learnt React, Express, MongoDB
In this project I will develop my own knowledge especially using Vue since I haven't used it before.

So my project will consist of a database in MongoDB which I will manage in Docker\
My backend will consist of a server in JavaScript using Express\
Frontend will then of course be using VueJs\
Last but not least I will host my files on GitHub for the public\
I will also try out Asana for project-planning

---

So the plan is to make a backend in Server.js in my backend-directory. This will be used as a bridge
between my database and frontend. What will exist in my backend-directory is following: \
NPM - 
Express to listen for ports and get information using CRUD
